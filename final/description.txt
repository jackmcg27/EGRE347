The code for this project is seperated into 2 Python files. The first is
main.py. This file serves as the driver. It runs indefinitly and contatins
the list of all of the circuits. It prompts the user for a slection based on the
list of options and based on their selection, calls the proper functions needed
to perform that option. The second file is transferFunctions.py. This file contains
all of the functions needed to perform the options. These functions range from creating new
circuits to priting things out. All of the heavy lifting is done here. The code functions 
based on a list of dictionaries that stores all needed information on the circuits.
Either a full dictionary is passed to a function or part of one. The function then uses data
from the dictionary to perform operations such as calcualting outputs, graphing the magnitude,
and displaying the transfer function. Each of these options is in its own function. Some of these
functions ahve subfunctions to help perform the operation or some call each other. Overall, the
list of saved circuits contains all of the data to perform any of the provided tasks, and the functions
in transferFunctions.py perform all of the options.

Reason for 2 videos:
Not shown in the main video is the LEDs due to not being able to screen record most of the functionality 
and then also record the real life physical pi. Given the normal pins that we have used this semester 
(red = 24, yellow = 5, green = 16), the LEDs will light up and stay on while working with particular
circuits. If the circuit is a lowpass, the green LED comes on. Yellow is for the band pass, and red is
for high pass circuits. I added a second video showing the pi as it calculates the magnitude plot for one
of each kind of function.
